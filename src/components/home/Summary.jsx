                <strong><em>RuPaul's Drag Race</em></strong> is an American reality competition television series, the first in the <em>Drag Race</em> franchise, 
                produced by <em>World of Wonder</em> for <em>Logo TV</em> (seasons 1-8), <em>WOW Presents Plus</em>, <em>VH1</em>(seasons 9-14), and beginning
                with the fifteenth season, <em>MTV</em>. The show documents RuPaul in the search for "America's next drag superstar". RuPaul plays the role of
                the host, mentor, and head judge for the series, as contestants are given different challenges each week. Contestants are judged by a panel that
                includes RuPaul, Michelle Visage, an alternating third main judge of either Carson Kressley, Ross Matthews, or Ts Madison, and one or more guest
                judge, who critique their progress throughout the competition. The title of the show is a play on drag queen and drag racing, and the title sequence
                "Drag Race" both have a drag-racing theme.
